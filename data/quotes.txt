Ricky tikki tavi, Bitch!
And thats the waaaaaay the news goes!
Hit the sack, Jack!
Uh oh! Somersault Jump!
AIDS!
And thats why I always say "Shum shum schilipiddydah!"
Grasssssssss... tastes bad.
No jumping in the sewer!
Burgertime!
*burp*
Why don't you ask the smartest people in the universe, Jerry? Oh yeah, *burp*, you can't. They blew up.
TO GET R*ugghhb*IGGITY RIGGITY WRECKED SONNNNN!
I'm Rick James, bitch.
I hate to break it to you, but what people calls "love" is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it. Your parents are gonna do it. Break the cycle, Morty. Rise above. Focus on science.
What about the reality where Hitler cured cancer, Morty?! The answer is don't think about it!
Who invited Abradolf Lincler?
It's like the N word and the C word had a baby and that baby was raised by every bad word for Jews.
Whatever you're asking, the answer is I'm amazing. And *away* we go!
All right, all right, cool it! I see what's happening here. You're both young, you're both unsure about your place in the universe, and you both want to be Grandpa's favorite. I can fix this. Morty, sit here. Summer, you sit here. Now, listen—I know the two of you are very different from each other in a lot of ways, but you have to understand that as far as Grandpa's concerned, you're both pieces of shit! Yeah. I can prove it mathematically. Actually, l-l-let me grab my whiteboard. This has been a long time coming, anyways.
An entire afternoon at BLIPS AND CHI-I-I-I-I-ITZ!!!!
SHUT THE FUCK UP ABOUT MOON MEN!! This isn't a musical number! This is a fucking... operation, we gotta be cool and fucking lay low.
Two things I wanna' make clear to EVERYBODY in this room: never betray me, and it's time to go.
The first rule of space travel, kids, is always check out distress beacons. 9 out of 10 times, it's a ship full of dead aliens and a bunch of free shit!
Thanks, Mr. Poopybutthole. I always could count on you.
You gotta get schwifty. You gotta get schwifty in here. It's time to get schwifty. Uh-oh. You gotta get schwifty. Oh, yeahhh. Take off your pants and your panties. Shit on the floor.
Morty, remember eight seconds ago when *burp* when you said "Go inside what?" and I said "The battery"? And then we showed up here and I wasn't like, "Whoa, this is unexpected. This is not what I was expecting, Morty. What a perplexing mystery this is."
I put a spatially tessellated void inside a modified temporal field until a planet developed intelligent life. I then introduced that life to the wonders of electricity, which they now generate on a global scale. And, you know, some of it goes to power my engine and charge my phone and stuff.
Ooh-la-la, someone's gonna get laid in college.
Huntin' a vampire with my grandkids!! FUCK!! TINY RICK!!!
So here I am! I'm Tiny Rick!
Let me out! Let me out! This is not a dance! I'm begging for help, I'm pleading for help! Please come let me out! I'm dying in a vat in the gara-a-age!
No, no, but I've been to a few planets with the same gimmick. Y'know, sometimes it's called the Cleansing or the Red Time. There was this one world that called it just Murder Night. I-It's a purge planet. They're peaceful and then, y'know, they just purge.
Morty, yehh-you're acting like a ehh-freaking lunatic. Calm down.
Alien bureaucrats are gonna arrest you. They're gonna put the intergalactic equivalent of ehh-jumper cables under your nuts and/or labia and hook 'em up to an alien car battery until you tell them where I am—which I guarantee you you're not gonna know, which I guarantee they won't believe. So who's homesick?
Y-Y-Y'know what those guys do i-in-in their fancy boardrooms? They take their balls and they dip 'em in cocaine and wipe 'em all over each other—y'know, Grandpa goes around and he does his business in public, because Grandpa isn't shady.
Sometimes science is a lot more art than science. A lot of people don't get that.
Nobody exists on purpose. Nobody belongs anywhere. Everybody’s gonna die. Come watch TV?
Life is effort and I'll stop when I die!
Let's save the measuring for when our dicks are out.
In bird culture, this is considered a dick move.
Hey, I'm squanchin' here!
This is why you don't freeze time, you guys. It's incredibly irresponsible.
What the hell is wrong with you two?! I-I-I-I..I mean, you four!
Whatever you're asking, the answer is I'm amazing. And away we go!
And away we go!
An entire afternoon at BLIPS AND CHI-I-I-I-I-ITZ!!!!
Thank you, Morty. You are not like other carbon-based lifeforms. You put the value of all life above your own.
Calling me "gearhead" is like calling a chinese person "asianface".
Well, scientifically, traditions are an idiot thing.
Yo! What up my glip glops!
Don't break an arm jerking yourself off.
25 shmeckles? I-I-I-I don't even know what that- what is that? Is that a lot?
Weddings are basically funerals with cake. If I wanted to watch someone throw their life away, I'd hang out with Jerry all day.
TINY RIIIIICK !!!!

I'm not looking for judgement, just a yes or no — can you assimilate a giraffe?
THE CONE-NIPPLE PEOPLE WILL RULE THIS WORLD!!!
You shut your mouth, you dirty knife-nipple bastards!!
What'd you say to me, you target-chest piece of shit!?!
RACE WARRRRR!!!!
Would everybody just relax for a second? There's no such thing as an "Uncle Steve", that is an alien parasite.
Oooohwee!
Thanks, Mr. Poopybutthole. I always could count on you.
Is anyone here even real?! AM I THE ONLY REAL PERSON ON EARTH!?!
You know me, I'm Reverse Giraffe. I have a short neck and legs. I went to college with Hamurai.

Coach Feratu? That was his real name? Like, his actual vampire name?
Mr. Smith, Shrimply Pibbles' life can be saved... if we replace his heart with your human penis.
Hey, listen. Is your mouth tiny and small? Then why don't you come down to Lil' Bits...
Eat some fucking shit, you fucking stupid bitch. Just kiddin'.

Awwww thanks, bitch!
Sometimes science is a lot more art, than science. A lot of people don't get that.
They'll just fall right out of my ass! I've done this too many times!
Existence is pain.
Dont look at me that guy over there roped ME into this
WHY'D YOU EVEN ROPE ME INTO THIS!
This is Principal Vagina. Don't let the name fool you, though. I'm very much in charge.
You know what a vole is, Morty? YOU KNOW WHAT A VOLE IS?
You're not gonna believe this, because it usually never happens, but I made a mistake
Did you just come in through a portal?
Then it's time to get your beak wet tonight playa!
Well look where being smart got you.
This isn't Game of Thrones, Morty
You're growing up fast, Morty. You're growing into a great big thorn straight into my ass...
Meeseeks don't usually exist for this long. It's starting to get weird.
Morty, can you get to the left nipple?
Nobody's killing me until after I catch my wife with another man.
5 more minute of this and I'm going to get mad!
Well look where being smart got you.
You're both pieces of shit. I can prove it mathematically
I JUST WANNA DIE!
Sometimes science is a lot more art than science. A lot of people don't get that.
Nobody exists on purpose. Nobody belongs anywhere. Everybody’s gonna die. Come watch TV?
Life is effort and I'll stop when I die!
Let's save the measuring for when our dicks are out.
In bird culture, this is considered a dick move.
Hey, I'm squanchin' here!
I'm sorry, Morty. It's a bummer. In reality you're as dumb as they come.
Oh, we're welllll past that, JERRY!
There is no god summer, gotta rip that band-aid off now you'll thank me later.
You ask alotta questions Morty, not very charismatic of you
ISN'T IT OBVIOUS MORTY? I FROZE HIM.
i think he said he loves lasagna
Aww, gee, you got me there, Rick.
I don't think we can perform our new song, The Recipe For Concentrated Dark Matter for a crowd this tiny!
That's Right Morty! This is gonna be a lot like that. Except you know. Its gonna~Belch~ make sense.
You're talking about Inception?
You don't have to try to impress me Morty.
I'm sorry, Morty. It's a bummer. In reality you're as dumb as they come.
"Puh rum pum pow!"
Where are my testicles, Summer?
Go home and drink, grandpa.
Well, she's my daughter, Summer. I outrank you. Or, family means nothing, in which case, don't play that card.
You're not gonna believe this, because it usually never happens, but I made a mistake
Don't even trip about your pants, dawg. We got an extra pair right here.
Oh no. I'm late to class, bitch.
My man!
i think he said he loves lasagna

"What is my purpose?"
WUBBA LUBBA DUB DUB!
What do you— what do you think of this f-flying vehicle, Morty? I built it out of stuff I found in the garage
We're gonna drop it down there, just... get a whole fresh start, Morty. Create a whole fresh start.
When I drop the bomb, I wa— [chugs booze] Y'know, I want you to have somebody, y'know... I want you to have the thing—I'm gonna make you like a new Adam and Eve, and you're gonna be Adam—
Alright, alright, Morty! Alright, alright, I'll... I'll land, I'll land, I'll land, I'll land the thing, I'll land the thing. Big tough guy all of a sudden.
It's a device, Morty, that when you put it in your ear, you can enter people's dreams, Morty. It's just like that movie you keep crowing about!
That's okay! I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me! Try again and keep your head down!
On one of our adventures, Rick and I basically destroyed the whole world, so we bailed on that reality and we came to this one. Because in this one, the world wasn't destroyed. And in this one, we were dead. So we came here, a-an-an-and we buried ourselves and we took their place. And every morning, Summer, I eat breakfast 20 yards away from my own rotting corpse!
Whatever you're asking, the answer is I'm amazing. And away we go!
I'm reeeeelly a brillllliant guy, I just get like dis so I can hang oud with my buddzzz!
An entire afternoon at BLIPS AND CHI-I-I-I-I-ITZ!!!!
The worlds can be one together, cosmos without hatred. Stars like diamonds in your eyes. The ground can be space (space, space, space, space). With feet marching towards a peaceful sky. All the moon men want things their way. But we make sure they see the sun. Goodbye, moon men. You say goodbye, moon men Goodbye—
Would everybody just relax for a second? There's no such thing as an "Uncle Steve", that is an alien parasite. 
You gotta get schwifty
You gotta get schwifty in here
It's time to get schwifty.
So he made a universe, and that guy is from that universe, and that guy made a universe... and that's the universe where I was born? Where my father died... Where I couldn't make time for his funeral because I was working on my universe.
Oh, they won't be slaves. They'll work for each other and pay each other money.
Huntin a vampire with my grandkids!! Tiny Rick!!
Damn, girl! You need to chill out! This whole thing was your idea in the first place, and now you're tryin to rush it along.
I’m begging for help, I’m pleading for help! Please come let me out! I’m dying in a vat in the gara-a-age!
Let me out! Let me out! This is not a dance.
Snuffles is my slave name, you can call me snowball.
He's not a hot girl. He can't just bail on his life and set up shop in someone else's.
That just sounds like slavery with extra steps!
Wait for the ramp Morty! They love the slow ramp.
What about the reality where Hitler cured cancer, Morty? The answer is: Don't think about it.
From now on, no more of this clever-name bullcrap. When a vampire is pretending to be a human, they can just call themselves Alan Jefferson or something like that.
It's a figure of speech, Morty! They're bureaucrats! I don't respect them. Just keep shooting, Morty! You have no idea what prison is like here!
It's like the N word and the C word had a baby and it was raised by all the bad words for Jews.
Get off the high road Summer. We all got pink eye because you wouldn't stop texting on the toilet.
GRAAAAAASSSSSSS.... tastes bad.
Wubbalubbadubdub!
Shut up ham-urai, shut up amish-cyborg. What is this? 90's Conan?
And that's the waaaaaaaaaaaaay the news goes!
Come on man, haven't we ever had an uncomfortable silence or an awkward fart on a road trip?
What do you— what do you think of this f-flying vehicle, Morty? I built it out of stuff I found in the garage
